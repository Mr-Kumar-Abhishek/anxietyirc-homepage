<h2>#anxiety Channel Rules</h2>

<p>Welcome :) Please take a moment to read the channel rules for #anxiety irc room.

  <p><b>Please note that any advice and diagnoses are to be considered anecdotal. We are not medical professionals and if you require immediate attention please call the crisis hotline in your area</b></p>

<div id="r1">
<a name="z2"><span class="p1">1. Be respectful, courteous <span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> </a>

<span class="p2">Will not tolerate harassment or trolling of any kind directed to other chatters. If you choose to disclose personal information in the main channel or in PM (such as Name, picture(s), email, cell number or other social media accounts) You do this at your own risk.
<p>Threatening to release this information out of spite/bribery/blackmail or as a personal attack directed to a particular individual(s) will result in a permanent ban and possible escalation to an IRCOP or local police.</p>
</span>
</div>

<div id="r2">
<a name="z2"><span class="p1">2. No offensive behaviour / Discrimination <span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> - No abusive language or actions toward other individuals</span></span></a>

<span class="p2">Although some people don't mind swearing, there may be others who are offended by vulgar language, so please keep it to a minimum. Discrediting remarks and put-downs, including prejudicial language directed at minorities or other groups that suffer discrimination, will not be tolerated under any circumstances..Any form of racism, sexism, homophobia, or any other sort of prejudice will not be tolarated. If you are found to be discriminating against a particular group of people you will be kicked immediately</span>
</div>
<div id="r3">
<a name="z3"><span class="p1">3. Politics or religion</span></a>

<span class="p2">Both religion and politics are prone to cause arguments between people who disagree. Because we at #anxiety prefer to keep things a drama FREE environment, AND because people in the channel follow MANY different faith paths, and have differing political beliefs, these topics are therefore not allowed. If you wish to discuss religion and/or politics with someone, do so in PRIVATE, or in a channel specially set up for discussions of that nature. Not in #anxiety</span>
</div>
<div id="r4">
<a name="z4"><span class="p1">4. Private Messages (PM) </span></a>

<span class="p2"> If would like to PM (Private Message) another user, you must first ask permission in the main chatroom. Do not PM anyone without first getting his/her permission.Respect the user's decision if he/she declines.</b></span>
</div>
<div id="r5">
<a name="z5"><span class="p1">5. Channel Lanuage  </span></a>

<span class="p2">The official language of the #anxiety channel is english. There is no auto-translator tool available for IRC. Please locate a suitable web translator before chatting</span></div>

<div id="r6">
<a name="z6"><span class="p1">6. No third party bots</span></a>

<span class="p2">Users are not allowed to bring bots into this channel. Both the bot and the user will be kicked.</span>
</div>

<div id="r7">
<a name="z8"><span class="p1">7. Stay out of suspected troll, drug, porn, and illegal channels <span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> -</span></span></a>

<span class="p2">In our experience, a large amount of the problematic behaviour on the channel can be resolved by simply blocking entry to our channel when a person is hanging around in suspect or troublesome channels on IRC. There are some channels on IRC that if we notice a person is in, they will be banned. Feel free to send a PM to an operator to chat about this if you like. Ultimately though, it is our call and unfortunately it is a measure we have found necessary to make to make all of our lives easier. Please respect that decision.</a></span>
</div>

<div id="r7">
<a name="z8"><span class="p1">8. Drug talk <span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> -</span></span></a>

<span class="p2">Please keep talks about self-medicating, illegal drugs, and marijuana to a minimum.Failure to do so may result in a ban</a></span>
</div>

<div id="r8">
<a name="z8"><span class="p1">9. No Cybering / cybersex / cyber-making-out / sexual roleplay / ASL <span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> -</span></span></a>

<span class="p2">This room serves as a anxiety support channel, not a porn / pick up channel - either take it to PM or take it to another channel. We in #anxiety are not interested in your extra activites. Failure to do so will result in a ban</a></span>
</div>

<div id="r10">
<a name="z8"><span class="p1">10. Connecting using Mobile devices<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> -</span></span></a>

<span class="p2">We welcome everyone to #anxiety. We ask that if you connect using a mobile device such as a phone or tablet. Leaving it connected to idle may result in a ban if constant disconnect/reconnects occur from your device. Please PM an op to have the ban removed.Remember, it isn't personal.</a></span>
</div>

<div id="r11">
<a name="z8"><span class="p1">11. Discussion of suicide in #anxiety<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> -</span></span></a>

<span class="p2">
 <li>Do not sensationalize suicides</li>
 <li>Do not romanticize suicides</li>
 <li>Never portray suicides as heroic</li>
 <li>Never say that a suicide “ended pain” or “ended suffering.” Suicide CAUSES excruciating pain for suicide survivors</li>
 <li>People need to be alive to feel relief from pain. Suicide CAUSES pain</li>
 <li>Be careful about describing the methods used. Do not go into great detail about the methods, and do not show detailed pictures of the locations where the suicides occurred</li>
<li><b>Suicide is never the answer. Getting help is the answer!</b></li>

</div>
<div id="r12">
<a name="z8"><span class="p1">12. Final Word from the opererators<span style="font-size: 0.9em;"> -</span></span></a>

<span class="p2">These rules serve as a guideline. Your common sense is also encouraged. If are asked by an OP to stop doing something, or to change the topic, etc., and you choose not to change your behavior, then this shows to us that you also are choosing to accept whatever consequences may be given to you. Keep in mind that these rules were made to encourage a pleasant, safe and supportive place to chat for everyone. If you don’t like the rules, then don’t come here. Nagging about the rules will not change them.</a></span>
</div>

<div id="contact">
<span class="p1">Who to contact</span>

<span class="p2">If you have any concerns/issues, please contact one of the <a href="mods/mods.html">Operators</a></span>.
